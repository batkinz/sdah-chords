[C]Now, dear Lord, as we [Dm]pray,
take our [G]hearts and minds far a[Cmaj7]way

to your [G]throne where grace does a[C]bound.
May our [F]lives be transformed by Your [C]love,
may our [Am]souls be re[D]freshed from a[Gsus]bove[G].
At this [Cmaj7]moment, let people every[Dm]where
join us [G]now as we [G7]come to You in [C]prayer.
