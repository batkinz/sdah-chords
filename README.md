Sevent-day Adventist Hymnal with guitar chords

## Intro
I have been playing the guitar in the [SDA International Church of Copenhagen](sdaicc.dk) for the past few years. We only had piano players sporadically, so most of the time we only have my guitar accompaniment. At first I tried to play along by ear, but that quickly turned out to be pretty difficult for some songs. I have searched and found some chords on the internet for some songs in our hymnal, but I couldn't find a source that would have had all of them, or even the ones that we most frequently we use weekly. So I have started spending a little time at home, writing chords for the more challenging songs that we sing in our church.
Lately some people who can also play wanted to join the team and kept asking me for my chords. So here they are, shared online, openly available for you to use.

I have a few years of formal music education, but I am not a professional musician. I am paying attention to write chords in an easy key that is close to the original key the hymn is written in the hymnal. I also provide the capo setting. I am not infallible and sometimes my chords disagree with the piano accompaniment. Nonetheless I am trying to do my best to write chords that can be played together with the piano accompaniment written in the hymnal. Check out the section [Contribute](#contribute) to find out how you can add improvements.

## Plans
Stages:
 1. Uploading the hymns that I have already written down
 2. Adding songs that I consider easier (the ones I usually play by ear)
 3. Adding the rest of the hymns that we don't usually sing in SDA ICC

## Technical details
I use the [ChordPro](https://www.chordpro.org) format, because it's simple and freely available. This is a plain text format that can be compiled to PDF form by the project's own tool. Since the format is open, this source can be potentially reused in multiple environments (e.g. different converters, apps). For now I am planning to upload the compiled PDF files here for easier access. Later on they might be moved to an external site, so only the source files remain here.

## Contribute
GitHub makes it easy to contribute. If you have questions, create an issue. If you have corrections create a pull request. If you are new to this system, you can also just send me an [email](mailto:bence.makkos@gmail.com?subject=sdah-chords). I will do my best to reply fast.
